# Third Party Functionality

Since 3.0, `cornerstoneTools` comes with third-party support so that one can easily drop new common functionality into `cornerstoneTools`, then construct new custom Tools which expand upon core and third-party functionality.

The third-party architecture comes with the advantage of not having to maintain a fork of the entire codebase, should you wish to include some custom/bespoke functionality. However, if you think something you have developed would be valued by the wider Cornerstone community, please consider submitting a pull request and contributing it back.
