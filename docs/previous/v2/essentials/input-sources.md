# Input Sources

Cornerstone Tools provides support for a number of input sources which can be used to create interactive tools.

Currently, we provide four input sources: **mouse**, **mouseWheel**, **touch**, and **keyboard**. Each of these input sources triggers a number of events which can be used by tools. This section will explain the events triggered by each of these input sources.

### Common Event Data

Each of the input types triggers separate events for use by tools. The following properties are common to all events:

Property | Type | Meaning
------------ | ------------- | -------------
event | [Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) | The original browser event which caused the Cornerstone Tools event to be fired.
element | [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) | The DOM Element for the Cornerstone Enabled Element which is the target of this event.
viewport | Viewport | The Cornerstone Viewport object for the specific Enabled Element at the time the event was fired.
image | Image | The Cornerstone Image object for the specific Enabled Element at the time the event was fired.
type | String | [Event.type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/type)

#### Coordinates

Coordinates are currently represented as:

````
Object {
  page:   { x: Number, y: Number },
  image:  { x: Number, y: Number },
  client: { x: Number, y: Number },
  canvas: { x: Number, y: Number }
}
````


### Mouse Input Source

The mouse input source triggers the following events:

Event Name | Meaning
------------ | -------------
**cornerstonetoolsmousedown** | ** Mouse Down ** <br> This is fired from the browser's [**mousedown**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mousedown) event.
**cornerstonetoolsmouseup** | ** Mouse Up ** <br> This is fired from the browser's [**mouseup**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseup) event.
**cornerstonetoolsmousedownactivate** | Mouse Down, and no tool is present at the current location to respond to the event.
**cornerstonetoolsmousedrag** | ** Mouse move while mouse button held down **
**cornerstonetoolsmousemove** | ** Mouse move without mouse button held down **
**cornerstonetoolsmouseclick** | ** Mouse Click **
**cornerstonetoolsmousedoubleclick** | Two mouse clicks in quick succession. This is fired from the browser's [**dblclick**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/dblclick) event.

#### Event Data
The mouse input events include the following event data:

Property | Type | Meaning
------------ | ------------- | -------------
which | Number | The jQuery 'which' value for the mouse buttons which were held down when the event occurred. These are computed from the [event.buttons](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/buttons) values [here](https://github.com/cornerstonejs/cornerstoneTools/blob/c9807489e5085f7a6720dd7e5943028aad747516/src/inputSources/mouseInput.js#L11). In future iterations (possibly 3.0) of Cornerstone Tools, we plan to deprecate the 'which' value in favour of the 'buttons' value.
startPoints | Cornerstone Coordinates | The starting coordinates for the mouse event (e.g., for a cornerstonetoolsmousemove event, this is the location where the initial mouseDown event started).
currentPoints | Cornerstone Coordinates | The current coordinates
lastPoints | Cornerstone Coordinates | The final coordinates
deltaPoints | Cornerstone Coordinates | The change in coordinates
ctrlKey | Boolean | [MouseEvent.ctrlKey](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/ctrlKey)
metaKey | Boolean | [MouseEvent.metaKey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/metaKey)
shiftKey | Boolean | [MouseEvent.shiftKey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/shiftKey)

**Note**: ctrlKey, metaKey, and shiftKey are only currently included in eventData for **cornerstonetoolsmousemove** events.

#### Usage
```js
const element = document.querySelector('.my-cornerstone-element');
// Enable mouse input
cornerstoneTools.mouseInput.enable(element);

cornerstoneTools.mouseInput.disable(element);
```

#### Event Data
The **cornerstonetoolsmousewheel** event includes the following event data:

Property | Type | Meaning
------------ | ------------- | -------------
pageX | Number | [pageX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/pageX)
pageY | Number | [pageX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/pageY)
